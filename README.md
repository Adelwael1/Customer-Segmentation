# Project Description: Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning
As a Data Scientist, this project focuses on implementing customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques to classify customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns. By analyzing customer data, businesses can personalize marketing strategies, enhance customer experience, and optimize resource allocation.

## Key Objectives:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather customer transaction data, clean missing values, and normalize features for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, correlations, and patterns in customer spending habits, frequency, and demographics.

Feature Engineering: Select and transform relevant attributes such as purchase history, customer lifetime value (CLV), frequency, and recency.

Clustering Techniques: Apply K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to segment customers into meaningful groups.

Evaluation & Interpretation: Use silhouette scores, elbow method, and Davies-Bouldin index to validate cluster quality and provide business insights.

Business Impact & Recommendations: Interpret results to help companies target specific customer segments with tailored promotions, loyalty programs, and retention strategies.

By leveraging machine learning-driven segmentation, businesses can make data-driven decisions that improve customer engagement and drive revenue growth.
